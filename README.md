## Project Structure

- `socket_server.py`: Server-side socket handling and database operations
- `kawaii_chat_client.py`: Client application with GUI
- `database_setup.sql`: SQL script to set up the database

## Technical Details

### Socket Communication

The application uses raw TCP sockets for communication between clients and the server. Messages are serialized as JSON for easy parsing and handling.

### Database Schema

- `users`: Stores user information including credentials and online status
- `messages`: Stores all messages with sender, receiver, content, and read status

### Message Delivery

Messages are immediately delivered to online users and stored in the database for offline users. When a user logs in, any unread messages are retrieved and displayed.

## Customization

You can easily customize the appearance by modifying the color theme in the `THEME_COLORS` dictionary in the client code.

## Future Enhancements

- Group chat functionality
- File sharing capabilities
- Custom themes selection
- Profile picture upload
- Message reactions and stickers
